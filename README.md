Some people prune bonsai trees. I refactor my dotfiles.

## How I use this repo

### Notes on compatibility & portability

* These dotfiles are written to be portable between macOS (10.5+), Cygwin,
  MSYS2, Windows 10's Linux Subsystem, and both BSD and GNU flavours of \*nix.
* I try to conform to the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg]:
  configuration for `foo` lives in `~/.config/foo/`, etc.
* Everything in `environment.d/` and `sh/` is compatible with any POSIX shell.
* My bash config files can be run (with gracefully degrading functionality) on
  anything from bash-3.2 to the latest 5.x release.
* Sadly, most of my fish configuration files can only run on 3.0.0 or newer.

### General usage

* My primary machine at home is a 2015 iMac that dual boots macOS Mojave and
  Windows 10; I also have a 2011 MacBook Air running High Sierra. My day-job
  computer is a very fast Dell with Windows 7, Cygwin, and no admin login. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ
  And I frequently SSH into web servers running various flavours of Linux.
* Dropbox keeps things synced between my Windows and Mac machines, and a
  custom `rsync` script pushes changes to my Linux boxes.
* On Windows, I use nightly builds of the venerable [PuTTY]; on Mac, I prefer
  [iTerm2] over the built-in Terminal.app; on iOS, there is only [Prompt].
* As of April 2019, I'm transitioning from a long-term relationship with
  Sublime Text to something more... passionate... with Visual Studio Code.
* Files that can be safely published to this GitHub repo live in `~/.config/`.
  Everything else lives in `~/.private/`, which is encrypted by [Keybase].

### Shell startup files

* `environment.sh` loads environment variables from `environment.d/*.sh` for all
  POSIX shells
    * `fish/conf.d/___env.fish` does the same for `fish`
    * `misc/launchd.conf` makes them available to macOS GUI apps
* `~/.profile` is a symlink to `sh/profile.sh`, which sources
  `sh/profile.d/*.sh`
* `~/.bashrc` is a symlink to `bash/bashrc.bash`, which sources `bash/_*.bash`,
  `bash/*.d/*.bash`, and (if present) `~/.local/config/bashrc.d/*.bash`
    * `~/.local/config` is a symlink to `~/.config/local/$HOSTNAME/config`, if
      it exists
    * `bash/init.bash` and (if present) `~/.local/config/init.bash` are sourced
      immediately before the first prompt
    * `bash/logout.bash` and (if present) `~/.local/config/logout.bash` are
      sourced when `bash` exits

### Setting up a new homedir

Minimum requirements:

- `.config/` ‚Üê this repo
    - `bash/`
    - `dircolors/`
    - `environment.d/`
    - `readline/`
    - `sh/`
    - `vim/`
    - `environment.sh`
- `.private/` ‚Üê from encrypted repo
    - `bashrc.d/`
    - `environment.d/`
    - `ssh/`

Then:

```sh
cd ~ && ln -s .private/ssh ~/.ssh
cd ~/.config && make shell-files symlinks
```

Then restart the shell.

## How you can use this repo

In ascending order of difficulty:

* Browse it! It's on GitHub for a reason. Important directories have `README`
  files explaining their contents, usage, setup, etc.
* Clone it. You're [more than welcome][licence] to integrate anything cool
  you find into your own dotfiles.
* Fork it? I guess? Everything's _extremely_ personalized; I do not expect and
  cannot guarantee that these will work "out of the box" for anyone but me.

The only condition‚Äîand it's a personal request, not a legal requirement‚Äîis that
if you find anything in this repo interesting or useful, [drop me a note][email]
and say so.
